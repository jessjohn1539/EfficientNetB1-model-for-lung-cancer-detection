# EfficientNetB1 Model for Lung Cancer Detection using Biopsy Images

## Problem Statement

- Accurately differentiating between benign and malignant lung cancer cells in histopathological biopsy images poses a significant challenge in medical diagnosis.
- This obstacle delays timely and effective lung cancer type detection, ultimately affecting patient care and treatment outcomes.
- Manual assessment by pathologists can be time-consuming and subject to human error, impacting timely and effective treatment. 
- Developing a computer vision model for automated lung cancer detection using biopsy images aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, expedite the evaluation process, and improve patient care outcomes.

## Scope of the Project

- Enhancing the model's interpretability to aid medical professionals in understanding the reasoning behind predictions.
- Extending the model to classify specific lung cancer subtypes, allowing for even more targeted treatment approaches.
- Integrating real-time analysis capabilities to assist in intraoperative decision-making during surgeries.
- Collaborating with pathologists to continuously improve the model's performance through iterative updates and training on diverse datasets.
- Expanding the framework to encompass other cancer types, thereby contributing to a comprehensive diagnostic tool for various malignancies.

## Objectives

1. Create a highly accurate machine learning model capable of distinguishing between benign and malignant lung cancer cells in histopathological images. 
2. Enable healthcare professionals to leverage the model's predictions for timely diagnosis, leading to tailored treatment plans and enhanced patient outcomes. 
3. Establish a versatile framework for further expansion, encompassing the potential to refine classification accuracy, incorporate subtype classification, and contribute to ongoing research in lung cancer detection
